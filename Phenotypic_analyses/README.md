#Phenotypic analyses
Phenotype_analyses_final.R - R script to import raw data, convert flower data measurements (e.g., transform dates to days post germination and convert mm nectar in capillary tube into volume in uL), inspect distributions of raw data, average measurements by individual, combine measurements from different raw datasheets, transform phenotypes (derived shape measurements and transformations for QTL mapping), export data for QTL mapping, summarize measurements by species and generation, test for the ratio of purple to white flowers differing from 3:1, tests comparing the phenotypes of F2s that produced different numbers of flowers, tests comparing F1 and F2 means to midparent values, phenotypic correlations, and code to produce the correlation plot Appendix S8
